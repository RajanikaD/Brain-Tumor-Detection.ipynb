# üß† Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

A deep learning-based solution to detect brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project demonstrates preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization of a CNN model for binary image classification.

## üîç Problem Statement

Brain tumors are one of the most life-threatening conditions. Early and accurate detection can improve diagnosis and treatment planning. This project aims to build a CNN classifier that can distinguish between **tumorous** and **non-tumorous** brain MRI scans.
